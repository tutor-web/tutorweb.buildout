Managing classes in Tutor-web
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a new teacher
======================

There is a tutor-web specific role a user can have, "Teacher". This allows the user to:

* View the contents of questions

When creating an account for a teacher, check the box. If they have already been created,
go to "Users and Groups" in the site control panel, and add "Teacher" to that user.

Creating a new class
====================

New classes can be created within the "Schools and Classes" folder, like any other content
in Plone.

Teachers cannot create classes, but if you allow them to edit an existing class then they
can manage who is part of the class and look at student results.

* Click on the "Sharing" tab for the class in question
* Search for the user, and click their "Can edit" box

Adding/removing members of a class
==================================

If you edit a class there is a text box full of the usernames of students in that class.
Removing from this list will remove the student from the class, equally adding will add
them to the class.

If you have many students to add, use the "Bulk add students" tab which lets you paste
in lots of email addresses, and will create any users that don't already exist.

Viewing grades of classes / lectures
====================================

A user can view the results of students in a class or lecture if they are allowed to edit the class/lecture.

This can be granted by going to the "Sharing" tab, searching for the user, check their "Can edit" box, and save.
